     <h3>How Rona Stores Works</h3>
          <p>
          The Buyer is a store owner/someone with a verifiable income stream and The Seller is someone who has stuff to sell.
          We act as the middle man between the 2 designations.<br> <br>
          
          When a verified buyer books an appointment with us, 
          we source for a seller from our long list of sellers and choose the most appropriate.<br> <br>

          The seller drops off his goods at our warehouse and we deliver to the buyer at only an 
          upfront payment of 20%. The seller pays up in 3 months, with just an interest rate of 10% per month. 
          The seller gets back his full payment in 3 months with an interest of 15%. <br><br>

          Everybody goes home happy! <br>
